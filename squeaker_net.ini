[system]
log_verbose: false

[servo]
# Configuration for a continuous rotation servo controlled
# through the Pi's PWM pin.

# the PWM pin on the Pi that will control the servo.
servo_pin: 18

# The PWM setting to keep the servo still.
pwm_still: 150

# This quantity will be added or subracted to the
# "still" value to make the servo turn. For my hardware
# 10 seems to be a good number. 100 is the outer limit (I think.)
crank_speed: 20

# time to turn the crank to dispense food (in seconds.)
crank_time: 2.4

[button]
# Configuration for a manual push button to activate the servo.

# the GPIO pin that will be connected to the button.
button_pin: 23

[lcd]
# configuration for a 16x2 Hitachi HD44780 (comptatible) LCD controller.
# squeakernet uses the 4-bit programming mode, so only six pins in total are required.

# Register Set
lcd_rs_pin: 4

# Enable
lcd_e_pin: 17

# data pins 4 through 7.
