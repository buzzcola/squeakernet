[servo]
# Configuration for a continuous rotation servo controlled
# through the Pi's PWM pin.

# the PWM pin on the Pi that will control the servo.
servo_pin: 18

# The PWM setting to keep the servo still.
pwm_still: 150

# This quantity will be added or subtracted to the
# "still" value to make the servo turn. For my hardware
# 20 seems to be a good number. 100 is the outer limit (I think.)
crank_speed: 20

# time to turn the crank to dispense food (in seconds.)
crank_time: 1.7
